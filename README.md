# Simple POS System for a Family Supermarket

## üéØ Project Overview

This project is a custom-built, lightweight Point of Sale (POS) system designed specifically for the daily operations of my family's small supermarket. The goal is to create a simple, intuitive, and efficient tool to manage inventory and sales, leveraging barcode scanning for speed and accuracy.

## ‚ú® Core Features (MVP - Completed)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is fully functional and focuses on the essential daily tasks:

- **Inventory Management:** A straightforward interface to add, search, and delete products from the inventory database.

*(A GIF demonstrating the MVP in action will be added here soon)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **GUI Framework:** *Tkinter*
- **Database:** *SQLite3*
- **Barcode Library:** *...*

## üöÄ Future Roadmap: 

- **Barcode Integration:** Add new products or look up existing ones instantly by scanning their barcodes.
- **Sales Recording:** A simple mechanism to record sales transactions.

###AI-Powered Automation

The next major phase of this project is to streamline the inventory onboarding process using modern AI technology.

- **Phase 2: LLM-Powered Invoice Scanning (Planned)**
  - **Objective:** Eliminate manual data entry for new stock by automatically scanning supplier invoices.
  - **Proposed Workflow:**
    1.  Scan a paper invoice using a standard scanner or phone camera.
    2.  Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and intelligently extract key product information (Product Name, Barcode, Price, Quantity).
    3.  The LLM will format the extracted data into a structured CSV or JSON file.
    4.  This file can then be batch-imported into the POS system, adding dozens of new products in seconds.

- **Phase 3: Modularization & Refactoring (In Progress)**
  - **Objective:** Refactor the current MVP codebase into a more modular architecture.
  - **Benefit:** This will simulate a professional development workflow, making the system easier to maintain, test, and scale for future features.

## üîß Installation & Usage
